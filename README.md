🌫️ AQI Prediction using Machine Learning


This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning models trained on environmental data. Built during our college hackathon, Inventum, the project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflows—from data preprocessing to deployment using a user-friendly web interface.

📌 Overview
Air pollution is one of the leading causes of health hazards in urban areas. This project aims to provide a predictive model for AQI based on pollutant concentrations (like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, etc.) and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
